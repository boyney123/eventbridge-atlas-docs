Event-Driven Architectures allow us to scale, be agile and keep our architecture decoupled. Ultimately I believe they help us work more efficiently.

When starting off with Event-Driven Architectures we spend time discovering our core business events, writing code to match them and maintain versions going forward.

Over a period of time **more events are added to our domain**, **requirements change**, and our architecture scales.

> It can become **difficult** to know and understand what events are flowing within our domain.

I'm a huge fan of [AWS EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/) and I wrote this tool to help engineers gain and keep an understanding of events that flow through their domain.
