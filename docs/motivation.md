Event-Driven Architectures allow us to scale, remain agile and decouple our architecture, ultimately I believe they help us work more efficiently.

When starting off with Event-Driven Architectures we spend time discovering our core business events and writing code to match them.

Over time more and more events are added, more developers join and our architecture scales.

It can become quite hard to know what events are flowing in our architecture and also what the events actually mean.

I wrote this tool to help architects, developers and business owners document their events within AWS EventBridge.

Event discovery can't just happen at the start of our build process...

**Event discovery should be organic and be accessible to everybody.**
