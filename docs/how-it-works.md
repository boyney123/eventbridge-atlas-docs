**EventBridge Atlas** is quite simple under the hood. It just merges a few tools together and generates documentation for our schemas.

You could split **EventBridge Atlas** into these parts.

1. AWS Integration
2. Markdown generation
3. Documentation generation

#### 1. AWS Integration

When you start the application it will require access to your AWS account (using aws-cli).

EventBridge Atlas will use cli commands to:

- Get your schemas from your event bus
- Get JSON and OpenAPI specs for yoru schema
- Get Targets for your events

> You will need to turn Event Discovery on for this application. But more on this later.

If you are interested in what commands are run you could read the code or here they are:

- `aws schemas list-schemas` - Gets the list of schemas
- `aws events list-rules` - Lists the rules for the events
- `aws schemas export-schema` - Gets the Schema data
- `aws schemas describe-schema` - Get extra information (Open API)

The runner also does a few other things:

Once the event data is gathered it generates markdown files.

#### 2. Markdown Generation

EventBridge Atlas will take the AWS information and generate the required markdown files needed for [docuowl](https://github.com/docuowl/docuowl).

Documentation pages are split by event source and then events.

#### 3. Documentation generation

Once the markdown is generated by **EventBridge Atlas** it will use [docuowl](https://github.com/docuowl/docuowl) to generate the website and documentation. Simple!

> There are two ways to run **EventBridge Atlas**, using docker or locally.
