Happy to share with you all that 1.0.0 is now out

#### Breaking Changes

- The way event-metadata is stored and populated has changed, hopefully making it easier for people to get started. Rather than having an `data/event-metadata.json` file you can now run `npm run generate-eventmetadata` which will populate your `data` directory with all the event meta data you need.

#### Features

##### Event Metadata in seconds

EventBridge Atlas will display your Schemas and Events for you, but requires you to fill in any descriptions or examples yourself. This used to quite a manual process, but now EventBridge Atlas has made this easier for you.

![Autogenerate metadata](/img/docs/1.0.0/1.0.0-example.jpeg 'Example of 1.0.0 feature')

##### Getting Started

When you clone the project run `npm run generate-eventmetadata` which will populate your event metata data for you.

Here is an example of the output

**/data/my-event-source/MyEvent.json**

```js
{
    "description": "My Event is raised when our system does something interested. Change this to what you want.",
    "detail": {
        "brand": {
