#### Features

##### Source metadata

EventBridge Atlas now allows you to write a `description` and list of `maintainers` for each source on your bus.

##### Why

This feature is another way you can help give extra context to team members about why your event sources may exist and their boundaries within your system. Some larger organisations also split domains by source, so you may have different people/teams managing the sources, you can now define who owns them and maintains them.

##### How to get started

When you run `npm run generate-eventmetadata` this will populate your `/data` folder with all your events.

Generate metadata will now also put a new file in your source directorys called `source-metadata.json`. This file will contain the `description` and `maintainers`. Running `npm run generate-eventmetadata` will populate a template for you.

Example

```json
{
  "description": "Here is a description of my source",
  "maintainers": ["David Boyne"]
}
```

File can be found in `/data/{source}/source-metadata.json`.

If you don't wish to run the generate script again you can simply just add the `source-metadata.json` file in the correct location.

**Everything here is optional, and the application will continue to work even if you don't have any source-metadta files.**
